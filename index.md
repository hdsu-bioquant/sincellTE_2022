# SinCellTE 2022 Single-cell Epigenomics & Multi-omics integration

![](./The_end.png)

Welcome to the **SinCellTE 2022 Single-cell Epigenomics & Multi-omics integration tutorial** This tutorial is divided in two sessions:
- On the first session we will guide you through all the necessary steps to perform a complete analysis of single-cell chromatin accessiblity (scATAC-seq) data, from raw files to inferring enrichment of transcription factors.
- On the second session we will focus on different strategies to combine scATAC-seq data with scRNA-seq data, from assays where both modalities were measured from the same cell.

<!-- ## Is this tutorial for me?

The aim of this tutorial is to learn how to use the R package ButchR to **perform signature identification in different types of genomic data using NMF**. To explore the results of an NMF analysis, we will provide a ready to use Docker image with RStudio, ButchR, and pre-loaded publicly available datasets, including bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data, as well as an interactive application. The tutorial will show how to run an NMF-based analysis from start to end.

If you are a computational biologist dealing with large scale omics datasets (e.g. RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, â€¦) looking for solutions to reduce the dimensionality of the data to a small set of informative signatures, this tutorial will be perfect for you.


### IMPORTANT NOTE! 

 While we will start at a very basic level, we would **strongly encourage absolute beginners**, who have never ever worked with R, to complete a very simple online R intro course on DataCamp (["Introduction to R"](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)), which will give you the very basic first concepts on what R is, and how to do some very simple operations with it.

In order to avoid any software compatibility and installation issues the practical sessions of the tutorial will be done using a Docker image, please follow the instruction given in [Run Docker image](#run-docker-image) to install Docker and run the Docker image for the tutorial before Monday, 13 September 2021.

## Practical sessions

### Session 1 - scATAC-seq analysis

On the "scATAC-seq analysis" session, we will guide you through the steps to perform a NMF decomposition using the R package ButchR on a publicly available RNA-seq dataset from the human hematopoietic system (Corces et al. 2016)

### Session 2 - Multi-omics integration

On the "Multi-omics integration" session we will complete an integrative analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptome data, using ArchR and Signac.
